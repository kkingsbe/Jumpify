# Jumpify
## The companion app to my homemade GPS tracker/datalogger for use while Skydiving!
Jumpify allows me to import data from my homemade GPS tracker/datalogger to view data from different skydives. The app allows me to view my vertical and horizontal speed, altitude, lateral displacement from activation point, as well as the ground track on a streetmap and the 3d track using Cesium (essentially google earth)

## The Home Screen

Overall statistics from all the data that has been brought into the app so far. These datapoints are the total number of jumps logged through the app, the total freefall time logged in the app, the number of jumps logged on the current day, the maximum speed reached, the maximum altitude reached, and the average deployment altitude.

## The Graphs Screen

Various graphs using the data gathered. These graphs include the total speed, altitude, vertical speed, lateral speed, and lateral dislacement from start point. These graphs all start from when the user jumps.
